# Welcome

This repository contains the code and files for the test assigned by the Utah LTAP

The task is to give a breakdown of how many miles per day are being completed by the team, using python. Along with that, demonstrate anything else using python and the provided data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The final program (main.py)takes the provided csv file, and creates a new one with two columns, one with dates, the other with miles travelled that day.
main.py also creates an interactive plot of the data using the plotly library
