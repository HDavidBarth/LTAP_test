# Welcome

This repository contains the code and files for the test assigned by the Utah LTAP

The task is to give a breakdown of how many miles per day are being completed by the team, using python. Along with that, demonstrate anything else using python and the provided data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**IMPORTANT: This program uses 3 packages for python that need to be downloaded. Plotly, pygame, and pygwidgets. To install these, open the command prompt on your computer and type in the following:**  <br />
    -for plotly type: `pip install plotly` <br />
    -for pygame type: `pip install -U pygame --user` <br />
    -for pygwidgets type: `pip install -U pygwidgets --user`


The final program (main.py)provides an interactive GUI for the user. It allows the user to select a CSV file in the format provided by LTAP, and creates a new csv file with two columns, one with dates, the other with miles travelled that day.

main.py also allows the user to create an interactive plot of the data using the plotly library

If you want to use the code, download code as a zip folder, open the Barth.Henry_LTAP folder and run the main.py file. It is suggested that you choose the StreetProvo.csv file to convert, others likely will not work.

The documentation.txt file contains some brief explanations of the code I wrote. Honestly I'm not sure what was expected but I gave it my best shot.
