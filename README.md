# Welcome

This repository contains the code and files for the test assigned by the Utah LTAP

The task is to give a breakdown of how many miles per day are being completed by the team, using python. Along with that, demonstrate anything else using python and the provided data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The final program (main.py)takes the provided csv file, and creates a new one with two columns, one with dates, the other with miles travelled that day.
main.py also creates an interactive plot of the data using the plotly library

If you want to use the code, download the Barth.Henry_LTAP folder and run the main.py file

The documentation.txt file contains some brief explanations of the code I wrote. Honestly I'm not sure what was expected but I gave it my best shot.
