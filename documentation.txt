This was a fun little test.

Not gonna lie, it took me longer than I thought it would. I ended up taking a couple hours. Turns out I didn't know how to use the datetime library, so it took me a minute to figure that out
to work with the dates in the data.

Also I've never written documentation before so I'm not sure what is expected, I'm going to try my best.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main.py program consists of 3 functions:

main() - 
    The main function automatically takes the provided path "StreetProvo.csv" and extracts the dates and distance travelled from that .csv
    After extracting that data, it organizes the data by date, as well as converting the distance from yards into miles.
    It puts all the final data into a new list and exports it into a csv file as well as plotting it nicely


splitDate(date) - 
    When a string is passed in with the format "MM/DD/YYY 12:00:00" it will split it and return only the month day and year


write2CSV(multiDimensionalList, headers, pathName) - 
    This function takes the final list which is created in the main, and exports it into a .csv file
	It uses a multidimensional list, custom headers (as a list), and a custom path name (string )as parameters




The modules folder contains 2 functions:

makeGraph(multidimensionalList, pathName) - 
    It takes a multidimensionalList where the x and y values of the graph are taken as the first element and second element, respectively, of each list in the list

	The pathname is a string which says where the plot will be saved, and what the file name will be.

	The data is plotted using the plotly library and is saved in a .html format


yard2Mile(yards) - 
    A value of yards is passed in (float or integer) 
    and the number of miles is returned
